# Description

A search engine where users input an address to access map location, weather conditions, and radiation levels, employing Google Maps API for address autocompletion and OpenWeather API for weather data. Utilizes a backend proxy server deployed on AWS EC3 for API key security and request routing.

# What I Learned
- Backend request routing with Node.js/Express.js.
- Hosting proxy server on Amazon Linux using the pm2 command for management.
- Securing API keys by employing environment variables on the proxy server.
- Securing HTTPS connections to the proxy server by generating SSL certificates with certbot and embedding them.
- Asynchronous programming and Promises in JavaScript.
- Hosting static websites with GitHub Pages.
